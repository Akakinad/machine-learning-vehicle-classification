# machine-learning-vehicle-classification
This project classifies vehicles (bus, car, van) using machine learning. It applies both supervised (Random Forest) and unsupervised (KMeans clustering) approaches. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature scaling, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and evaluating performance with metrics like accuracy and ARI.
